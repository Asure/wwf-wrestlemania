Doink has a fatality.  To execute it, do this:  BBFFBF P.
This doesn't seem to work, but rumor has it that it is done with P, and the
motions aren't exactly correct.  Still unconfirmed as this rumor will be
eliminated soon.

Default finish structure as planned:

Originally 2 finish move were planned, only takers' was implemented.

Let's check yoko.asm

1. yoko.asm 
	.if NUM_YOKO_FINISHES
	.ref	yok_finish1_move

NUM_YOKO_FINISHES is defined in GAME.EQU, so let's set it to 1

2. What does the finish move do?

	.if NUM_YOKO_FINISHES
- It's only in game code if this is set to 1, so production roms don't have this.
!!TODO: reverse engineer proto 2 rom that's out there.. Maybe they left it in?!!

Checks button combo and then does this:

	movi		yok_finish1_move,a0
	move		a0,*a8(SPECIAL_MOVE_ADDR),L
	DIE

It basically does the move animation, then die. 


3. FINISEQ.ASM this holds all the SUBR (these routines are all .def auto by the SUBR macro.)

 SUBR	yok_finish1_move
	.word	ANI_SETMODE,MODE_UNINT|MODE_NOAUTOFLIP	;uninterruptable
	.word	ANI_ZEROVELS
	.word	ANI_SETSPEED,100h

	.word	ANI_SETFACING		;ANI_XFLIP <- not primary anim
	.word	ANI_SET_WRESTLER_XFLIP

	.word	ANI_SETMODE,MODE_NORMAL
	.word	ANI_END

	.endif

4. So there's not much going on in FINISEQ.ASM, but there's some stuff in FINISH.ASM for yoko..
