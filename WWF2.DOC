I LIKE THIS GAME!!!  i had retired, but my friend mark dragged me back
to the arcade (thanx mark).  anyways, i was disappointed with what was
out there, so i decided to try something new.  if there's not a faq on this
game, i'm willing to start one.  i'll post a skeleton faq here.  i want
credit for a faq!!!  this game actually has strategy (something that other
wrestling games seem to ignore).  someone else can write some story lines
or whatever because the only wrestler i know of is hulk hogan and he isn't
in this game.  i was kicking major ass once i got the hang of it.
DOINK RULES!!!

wwf faq v0.9 (bodom)  (not quite 1.0 just yet!)  :P
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there is a defense button, but i use two different defenses.  i use the run
as an offensive and a defensive weapon.  you must learn this!  when someone
knocks you down, you can run away to get in a position.  a good move i use
is to run away, then quickly run towards and hit power kick.  good surprise
move.

there are 8 characters 
1) doink
2) razor ramon
3) bam bam bigelow
4) shawn michaels
5) yokozuna
6) the undertaker
7) lex lugar
8) bret hart

so far, there seems to be (at my arcade) 4 main characters people use.
the top 4 are
1) shawn michaels
2) the undertaker
3) doink
4) yokozuna

as a beginner, i suggest playing yokozuna to start with.  he's a solid
beginning character.  bam bam is also a decent starting character.

* CONTROLS *


  p           pp


        d


  k           pk


p = punch
pp = power punch
d = defense   (i still prefer to call it "block")
k = kick
pk = power kick

* THROWS *

i had some kid whining that i threw too much.  fuck him.  this is wrestling.
you are SUPPOSED to throw.  end of story.  learn defense and learn that run!
run is much better implemented than in mk3.  run is easier for me to do than
to find that awkward run button on mk3, but this is my opinion (i keep hitting
low punch a lot when i want to run).

throws are executed by tapping forward twice, then hitting pp (power punch).
your player will grab.  i haven't tested out throwing ranges just yet, but i
like doink a lot.  yoko and shawn are also great.

after grabbing the opponent, you have many options.  one is a high risk move
and the other is simply taps.  a high risk move is one that requires a double
tap.  after grabbing someone, tap down twice and hit pk (power kick).  this
will do a high risk move (for all fighters i think, but i'm not sure yet).
you can also tap punch and kick and do a repeated attack.  they can STILL
reverse while you're attacking with the repeated punches.  beware.

* BREAKING THROWS *

to break a throw, hit forward 3 times, then hit pp.  there may be many more,
but like i said, i only played it a few times, and didn't get much of a chance
to test much (well, i did cuz i was winning a lot, but anyways).  this will
do a reversal.

* COMBOS *

i didn't figure out what it really does.  with the combo lit up, you can
recover from a pin and only when it is lit.  i'm sure that there is some
super move you can do when this is lit, but i didn't try to find any.
do enough special moves, and your combo meter goes up.

* BUGS *

you know this is a midway game because it suffers from the SAME THING as mk3.
after a playing joins it, there is NO pause.  i got pissed when i kept
selecting razor ramon on accident.  this sucks.  midway please ditch this.

* BASIC ATTACKS *

like i said earlier, everyone has a basic throw attack and that's tap 2 forward
and pp.  also, running attacks, followed by power moves do dive moves.  any
button to a fallen opponent will pin him when it says pin him!  keep in mind,
that run is p+k.  use it, and use it wisely.  back and power attacks many
times do spinning attacks.  also, first attack of the round scores double
the damage!!  makes a good opening strategy.  do i risk it and do a high risk
super move or do i do something wimpy?  beats the hell out of getting useless
points for first attack (ssf2).

* CHARACTERS *

i only got the chance to play 4 characters, so i will also go into detail on
those 4.  doink is my favorite because he has good agility (useful for running
then hitting defense and then running again).

all grabs are ff+pp unless specified otherwise.

yokozuna:

belly dive:  ff+p
salt throw:  ?
face punches:  ff+p (close to opponent)  this will grab them.  good move for
               beginners.
spin throw:  grab, dd+pk


doink:

hammer:  ff+pk
big hands:  ff+pp (?)
body slam:  grab, dd+pk


the undertaker:

light ghost throw:  hcb+k  you can block this for no damage.  getting hit will
                    stun you momentarily.
dark ghost throw:   {k}+hcb 
                     (this means hold down kick, do the motion then release)
                     blocking this one takes damage and getting hit by it does
                     damage also.
warp move:  hct+p
fire uppercut:  warp move, dd+pk
big uppercut:  grab, dd+pk (?)


shawn michaels:

leg throw:  ff+pk  (good move) especially to counter undertakers projectiles
sweep throw: ff+k
rolling tackle:  (?)
4-hit combo:  shawn has a combo with 4 leg whips to the head.
              this one guy was being a sore asshole and wouldn't tell me how
              to do it, because he kept losing i guess.  asswipe.
              it's some move that involves kick.  i may  go test it sometime
              soon.

razor ramon:

5-hit throw combo:  pp, ff+pp
                    start whipping on that pp and while you're hitting them,
                    do the throw motion.  it all flows.  ouch!

everyone else is invited to fill in the rest.


the hell with mk3 and killer instinct.  wwf and bust-a-move are much better
games!  there was a bigger crowd around wwf for awhile than was around mk3.
i like the "extra bass" sound effects.  you can feel the pain when big
yokozuna sits one you.  hams, turkeys, barbells, bowling pins, etc. flying
from people's bodies got annoying to me after awhile, but i adjusted.

it'll be awhile before i go play again (i have to drive 30 miles across the
state line just to go play a decent arcade game.  sheesh!)
