X  HINT #1 - in-air pick-off
- When your opponent is running or leaping at you, away-away-punch can
  be used to pick him off and deliver a body slam.

  HINT #2 - repeat slams
- Many slams can be repeated by quickly pressing another button after
  beginning the move.  For example:  To perform Bam Bam's piledriver,
  press up-down-down-power kick from a headhold.  Then repeatedly press
  power punch for extra slams.

  HINT #3 - hyper mode
- Swirl the joystick to activate 'hyper mode' and move at double speed.
  Use it wisely: it only works once per match.

X  HINT #4 - ring out
- Don't stay out of the ring for long.  You suffer damage until you
  re-enter the ring or your opponent joins you outside.

X  HINT #5 - high-risk maneuvers
- Bounce off the ropes just before performing many jumping attacks for
  an extra damage bonus.

  HINT #6
- There is no hint #6.

X  HINT #7 - turnbuckle leaps
- Climb the turnbuckles and leap at your opponent.  Not only can you guide
  your flight with the joystick, but these attacks cannot be blocked.
  If you have trouble hitting, try aiming with your shadow.

  HINT #8 - charge-up moves
- Moves activated by a very long button press, such as Doink's buzzer and
  Razor's multi-slash, are an effective and surprising way to break out of
  a head-hold.

  HINT #9 - hazards of blocking
- Blocking can be dangerous!  Every wrestler has ways to hurt a blocking
  opponent if he can get close enough.  For example: toward - power punch
  from in close launches an unblockable head grab.

X  HINT #10 - combo mode
- Performing a variety of moves activates 'combo mode.'  This allows you
  to launch special devastating combo moves from the headhold.  Most
  combo moves begin with toward-toward-toward and a button press.

X  HINT #11 - reversals
- The attacker in a head-hold has many moves to choose from, but some of
  the more devastating ones, such as the piledriver, can also be performed
  by the victim.  When the victim does one, it's called a 'reversal', and
  it does double damage.
