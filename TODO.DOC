IN PROGRESS - Taker coffin.


DONE - Try to free up more program space.  NOTE - We gain about 16k by
       turning OFF debug mode.

       Jason fixed that problem.

DONE - end game pan around, faster fireworks, readable text, more text

DONE - attract mode instructions - secret moves (go from bio page to a bio page
       without text, instead put up three moves). NOTE - Need to finalize
       tips for each wrestler.

DONE - Fix some bullshit problem with some off brand watchdog chip gurnee
       decided to use.  What a cluster fuck!!!!

make the first drone a complete sissy
drones are too aggressive.  on the low difficulty settings, the drones don't
 win headholds, and they block poorly, which is good, but they still
 constantly attack, kamikaze-style.  On low settings, they should just stand
 around and/or circle their opponent more.
drones don't appear to begin trying to buckoff until they get pinned.  They
 should start the instant they die.
rzr has a leaping rugslam now - TT KICK
drones - shouldn't jump off turnbuckle so often in multi matches
make drones easier - especially match one
won 5 against humans, then drone kicked my butt - rules?
fix undertaker not pinning - taker walks back and forth real fast trying to
 look for a pin!
guys still walk into ropes for long time!
don't attack mode head hold humans - unless difficulty setting is hi!
Don't have drones do power moves unless human has.
Yoko should take advantage of salt throw
Drones should take advantage of missed buzzers, etc.
Have drones run back into ring
drones should NOT be able to mess with other drones when they are in the
 middle of a puppet move
Drone Taker drops people from chokehold
