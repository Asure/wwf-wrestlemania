i expect to get all the moves and the combo system down in the next couple
of weeks.  until then, here is a the 1.0 faq i've written.
if i get something revolutionary, then i'll post a v1.5 faq.
until the v2.0 comes out in a couple weeks, you can have this.

--> andy eddy, do ya want this??

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION PRESENTS...   W R E S T L E M A N I A

This is my first attempt at a faq from scratch.  Excuse me if i forget
the capital letters, because I'm not used to it.

Remember this is a V1.0 faq, so I'm not putting all the fancy biographies
and overview crap in it until later.  I'm just giving you the basics.

*** I N T R O D U C T I O N ***

there are 8 characters 
1) Doink The Clown
2) Razor Ramon
3) Bam Bam Bigelow
4) Shawn Michaels
5) Yokozuna
6) The Undertaker
7) Lex Luger
8) Bret "The Hit-Man" Hart

As of this writing, Bam Bam Bigelow seems to be the best character.  Also,
if you want to be cheap, The Undertaker can be the cheapest of all.

*** C O N T R O L S ***


  p           pp


        d


  k           pk


p = punch
pp = power punch
d = defense (block)
k = kick
pk = power kick

*** B A S I C  M O V E S ***

Every character can run.  To run, move your joystick in the desired direction,
and hit punch and kick at the same time.  The "big" characters have special
throws which are uncounterable and these are executed by pressing power punch
and power kick at the same time.  To grab someone, you tap towards twice and
hit power punch.  Obviously, hit punch makes you punch and so forth, so I
won't even bother mentioning obvious stuff like this.

run:           p+k
power grab:    pp+pk (some characters)
grab:          ff+pp
piledriver:    dd+pk (after grab)
drop kick:     run + power kick
body dive:     run + power punch
weapon attack: back + power punch or power kick
reverse throw: ff+pp or spaz

ok, that looks cleaner.

*** V E R S I O N ***

We just got the new chip here.  I didn't get much of a chance to recognize
the differences between the chips, so forgive me if some of the stuff listed
here doesn't work on your machine.  One way to easily tell if you have the
new chip is after both players select their fighter.  If it asks you whether
or not you want head to head or cooperative mode, then you have the new chip.
In a nutshell, cooperative mode SUCKS.  DO NOT PLAY COOPERATIVE MODE.  It
sucks because both you and your opponent have to fight all 8 cpu guys (2 at
a time).  Also, both of you collectively get only one bar of energy.  Even
worse, you only get one round.  What makes it suck really, REALLY hard is that
after your one bar is gone, both you and your opponent games are over.  If
you do happen to beat all 8 cpu opponents, the game will flash "you are the
world wwf champions" and that "you beat the game -- game over".  Once again,
co-op mode needs work.  I suspect another chip upgrade to fix this.

*** B U G S ***

On the old chip, I was playing Shawn Michaels and I did a sweep leg throw
to kill the guy and the game froze up.  It was a one-time bug, so I don't
know if this is consistent or not.  Also, our prototype version had a vcr
in it and it recorded everything.  After the tape got full, the game would
crash.  I don't know if all prototypes have vcr's in them, and I thought
it was very weird seeing the arcade guy go into the machine and change tapes.
Another annoying "feature" is the infamous mk3 "glitch".  When you join in,
there is practically no pause.  They added a slight pause on the new chip
(THANK GOD).  Even mk3 still doesn't have it yet.
Also, many special effects disappear when there are more than 2 "sprites"
on the screen at the same time.  Examples can be seen with The Undertaker.
When you do his fire uppercut, the fire won't appear when there are more than
2 sprites on screen and neither do the bats appear after he pins you.

*** R U M O R  M I L L ***

When playing this game, there are messages at the bottom of screen.  Little
messages like 2-round sweep, fast finish, and skill level.  Rumor has it
that after selecting your characters that this game may have nba jam style
codes.  After selecting your character, try tapping a button 10 times or
something.  It just seems like there are some secret codes, and if you know
midway, you know that there must be some easter eggs in there.

*** T H R O W S ***

I had some kid whining that I threw too much.  F___ him.  This is wrestling.
You are SUPPOSED to throw.  End of story.  Got that?

There are 3 types of throws.

type 1) FF+PP
This is the normal grab that everyone has.  Tap forward twice and hitting
power punch will attempt to grab the opponent.  Get the know your throwing
ranges!!  This is important!!  Grab from max range!  It's the secret to how
I get a lot of throws off.  hehehe

type 2) PP+PK
Some big characters have power throws.  These throws are unique for they hold
them up in the air, then slam them down.  What makes these throws really
good, is that they are NOT counterable.  You can't counter a power throw,
so a character who has a power throw is good.  Yoko, Lex, and BamBam are
some characters who have power throws.

type 3) ???
whipback throw.  Many times when you're repeating punching the the face of
some guy (using power punches), as they are reeling back you can execute
a throw in the middle of these punches and it will grab them and many times,
throw them out of the ring.  It's an over the shoulder kind of throw.  I
don't have the exact motions on this one, but Razor can do this one pretty
good.  Also, this throw is quick and uncounterable.

After grabbing your opponent, you have many options.  I think every character
has a universal move.  After grabbing them, hit DD+PK.  This will do a
standard pile driver for every character I believe.  Some characters have
other moves too (for example, quadruple throws!!).  These will be listed
in the individual section.

After grabbing the opponent, you have many options.  One is a high risk move
and the other is simply taps.  A high risk move is one that requires a double
tap. A fter grabbing someone, hit DD+PK (as I described above).  This
will do a high risk move.  You can also tap punch and kick and do a repeated
attack.  They can STILL reverse while you're attacking with the repeated
punches.  Beware.  High risk moves to me, aren't very much of a high risk,
but oh well.

*** R E V E R S I N G  T H R O W S ***

There are two main ways for reversing (breaking) throws.  One is a "clean"
way and hit 2 times FF and PP.  You may need to hit 3 times forward to
counter -- I don't really know what I do, but I need to investigate it
a little more.  Yet another way (which I see a lot of newbies doing) is the
"spaz method".  Just spaz on the joystick and buttons as if you're breaking
out of a dizzy.  Many times, when you spaz, you'll do a double throw instead.
Weird.  Needs to be investigated more.

*** C O M B O S ***

Do a lot of special moves (and throws) and your combo meter goes up.  With
your combo meter lit, you can actually recover from a pin.  You can't recover
from a pin if you don't have the combo lit up, so in many cases a pin is
quite optional.  When your combo is lit, after doing a type 1 grab (FF+PP),
you can start a BIG combo.  I've heard rumors of a 29 and a 33-hit by Razor
Ramon and I've seen 15 hitters from guys like Lex and Shawn.  I, personally,
have only figured out 1 combo, so whenever I get the big combos down, I'll
add them in the next upgrade of the faq.  I know a 20-hit with BamBam.
I'm not sure if all the motions are necessary, but this is what I do.
There are also pseudo combos.  One example of this is Shawn Michael's 4-hit
leg whip combo.  It's a true combo -- it just doesn't mention it.

20-hit BamBam combo:
FF+PP (to grab)
FF+PP, DD+P (for 1 sec), DD+K (for 1 sec), DD+PK (for 1 sec), DD+PP
so you simply do the grab move, then hit FF+PP to activate the combo.
Then you keep hitting down, while tapping on the punch button, and hit
the buttons in a counterclockwise direction.  This is one combo.  It is
a mk3 style combo where you hit sequences of buttons.  If you simply do
the FF+PP, it will do like about 8 hits.  So the key is finding the
optimal sequence of buttons are activating the combo.  Each character
activates their combos with different motions, I believe.  I just know
BamBam's is FF+PP.  You guys can take it from here.  I believe, the DD's
aren't necessary, but I will do more testing come payday (this Friday
coming up or whenever my damn income tax refund comes back).

  belly rush:  FF+P

  power grab:     PP+PK
  head knocker:   FF+P (close)
  leg spin throw: (power grab), DD+PK   (another cool throw)

*** C O N C L U S I O N ***

After extensive testing, this is probably the most balanced game out there.
BamBam looks strong, but he's slow.  Doink appears weak, but he has better
quickness.  Learn to use each fighters adv/disadv's.  Personally, I thought
The Undertaker was quite weak, but with his quick throws, he may be one of
the best.  No one character is inferior to any other this seems to be a
very promising game.  Over here, more people play this than mk3!!  Seriously!
The graphics are much cleaner and overall, this game rocks.  I thought I
would never say that about a wrestling game.  I love this game!
